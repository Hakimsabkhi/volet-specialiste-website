| `git status`         | Always a good idea, this command shows you what branch you're on, what files|
| `git push`       | Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.|
| `git log`     | Browse and inspect the evolution of project files.|
| `git commit -m "git commit message example"`      | This starts the commit process, but since it doesn't include a -m flag for the message, your default text editor will be opened for you to create the commit message. If you haven't configured anything, there's a good chance this will be VI or Vim. (To get out, press esc, then :w, and then Enter. :wink:)|
